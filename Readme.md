## Running the Project Locally

To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   First, install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**  
   After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the project, and you should be able to access it at `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.

## Running with Docker

If you prefer to run the project using Docker, you can do so by executing the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5173:5173 habitopia1
```

This command will start the container and map port 5173 from the container to your local machine, allowing you to access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.
